A small update has been [released on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mldr), including a GUI redesign and better ability to read datasets from it.

## GUI design changes

Some changes have been made to the web interface of mldr. This design saves more space, better highlights content and is less distracting while being visually appealing.

## Loading MEKA datasets from GUI

Users are now able to load MEKA-style datasets (in ARFF format without a XML file for labels) from the web interface as well. To do this, just upload the ARFF file and click *Load dataset* without selecting any XML file.
